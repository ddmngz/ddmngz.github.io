# Fastly Internship | Summer 2023
## Overview
At Fastly, I optimized and helped redesign a recently ported Rust program, essential to the functionality of Fastly's CDN. All in all, I:
* Reduced memory usage by ~40%
* Reduced process load by ~20%
* Rewrote critical functions to remove unnecessary state and increase readability
* Profiled the program using perf + flamegraphs, coz, and strace to find expensive operations
* Documented the codebase with rustdoc and an internal wiki
* Secured supply chain dependencies with [cargo-vet](https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet)


## Skills
Working on the project taught/improved my familiarity with the following:
* Idiomatic Design for Rust
* Asynchronous Programming with [Tokio](tokio.rs)
* Profiling in testing and production
* Performance in Rust
* Jenkins & Docker CI
* General Release Engineering
* Collaboration with my Mentor and other members of the team
* Weekly update meetings
* Documenting internal projects for developers

# Software Systems Lab | Spring 2023
## Overview
In my Spring semester, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for [Jason Nieh](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/) at Columbia. This entailed the following:
* Extended Linux kernel syscalls to support experimental architecture for research project
* Coordinated and onboarded other Undergrads

## Skills
* Working on a large, undocumented codebase
* Maintaining Communication in an Unsupervised environment
* Linux syscall Infastructure
* Writing Idiomatic C in a high-risk environment
