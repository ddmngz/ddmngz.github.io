## Reliable Data Transfer over UDP (2 projects)
**Computer Networks  | C & Rust |**

* Chat app in C designed from scratch with only standard library
* Stop and Wait Protocol for Reliable Data Transfer over UDP
* Group chat and multiple user funcitonality

* two user chat app in Rust using standard library
* Go-Back-N Protocol for Reliable Data Transfer over UDP
* Multithreaded for simultaneous send and receive & non-blocking i/o

## Bellman ford shortest-path simulation
**Computer Networks  | Rust |**

* Second part of Rust chat app. 
* Different ports on the same network simulated a router subnet
* Each instance of the program sent it's own distance vectors to other instances to find shortest path

## Ezfs implementaiton
**Operating Systems | C |**

* Implmementation of simple filesystem using Linux kernel VFS
* Required looking into documentation and other filesystem implementations

## Scheduling class!
**Operating Systems | C |**

* Design a scheduler that beats Linux's Default in terms of average completion time
* Design part: Thinking about how to measure completion time and minimize it
* Understanding why Linux doesn't optimize for completion time
* Understanding and implementing scheduling class in the linux kernel
