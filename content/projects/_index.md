# My Projects!

As you can see, my main areas of interest just for personal projects are Productivity, Open Source, a little bit of Cryptography, and mostly Rust and C!
Here's some brief reviews of my favorite projects, but you can also take a look at my full [coursework](coursework) and [personal](personal) projects!

## Compression By Function
For fun this January I started making a small program in Rust to encode arbitrary files as functions! It's been really fun exploring the intersections of math and Computer Science, and collaborating with mathematicians to discover the tools and mathematical machines required to solve this problem!

## Networking in Rust
For computer networks, I needed to do some network programming in Rust using the standard library, which was so fun! It made me realize which crates I take for granted, and gain a better understanding of the Rust sockets API.

## Kernel Scheduling
For Operating Systems, me and my partner had to develop a scheduling class that beat Linux's default scheduler. It was a really interesting probem solving issue, where I could also use some strategies I learned in Computer Networks. As always, it was also incredibly interesting to look into the Linux kernel and see how they do specific functions

## Full-Stack Development
For Columbia Lion Dance, I needed to maintain and update a webapp that a previous member had made to streamline club workflow. I learned a lot in taking on the project, and I was able to also update the project and design my own solutions!
