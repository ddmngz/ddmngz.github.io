# Personal Projects

{{< github repo="culiondance/culd-hub" >}}
I inherited CULD Hub from an old member of the Colkumbia University lion dance club, Ethan Wu. He made it as a tool for organizing club performances, but also as a way to learn web app development! At first, it was simply a matter of learnign the technologies, understanding the codebase, and migrating it off of Heroku, but nowadays I've been working on it on my own! Adding new tools such as Equipment Management, Reimbursement Automation, and an Availability Display!

{{< github repo="ddmngz/emdash.sh" >}}
Emdash was born from the conjuction of the desire for a bespoke, simple dashboard for productivity, fascination with TUI applications, and admiration for the design of VIM. I wanted a productivity application that encouraged use over endless reconfiguration, without sacrificing configurability. For me personality, I wanted something to parse my obsidian vault and render a dynamic dashboard, but I think generally speaking, it's really important for producitivty tools to be configurable, because everyone's brain works differently, so I went about generalizing it in a way that would allow other people to use it as well.

I thought it would be interesting to try compressing a file by generating a function that would produce the file on a given seed, and storing the seed and the function. This has been a really interesting vehicle to learn more about cryptography and hash functions, and I'm really excited to see how the implementation turns out!

## SimpleCal (FUTURE PROJECT)
My main principle of design comes from the MIPS Assembly language. One of their main principles was "make the most common instructions the fastest." I want to try my hand at applying that in a Calendar Application, where the two most common uses are Viewing, and adding tasks. I want to make a calendar app that's simple, lightweight, easy to look at (and screeenshot), and easy to add tasks to 

## Musescore Contribution (FUTURE PROJECT)
As a passionate jazz musician, Musescore has been essential to my development. Whether it's transcribing solos, arranging songs for friends, or even composing my own music, Musescore has been such an incredibile reliable tool, and it consistently blows my mind that such a project is open-source. So, this january, I'm excited to start contirbuting to their codebase, so I can be a part of this incredible project!
