# Personal Projects

{{< github repo="ddmngz/cbf" >}}

I thought it would be interesting to try compressing a file by generating a function that would produce the file on a given seed, and storing the seed and the function. This has been a really interesting vehicle to learn more about cryptography and hash functions, and I'm really excited to see how the implementation turns out!

{{< github repo="culiondance/culd-hub" >}}

I inherited CULD Hub from an old member of the Columbia University lion dance club, Ethan Wu. He made it as a tool for organizing club performances, but also as a way to learn web app development! At first, it was simply a matter of learning the technologies, understanding the codebase, and migrating it off of Heroku, but nowadays I've been working on it on my own! Adding new tools such as Equipment Management, Reimbursement Automation, and an Availability Display!


## SimpleCal (FUTURE PROJECT)
My main principle of design comes from the MIPS Assembly language. One of their main principles was "make the most common instructions the fastest." I want to try my hand at applying that in a Calendar Application, where the two most common uses are Viewing, and adding tasks. I want to make a calendar app that's simple, lightweight, easy to look at and easier to use!


## Musescore Contribution (FUTURE PROJECT)
As a passionate jazz musician, Musescore has been essential to my development. Whether it's transcribing solos, arranging songs for friends, or even composing my own music, Musescore has been such an incredibly reliable tool, and it consistently blows my mind that such a project is open-source. I'm super excited to start contributing to their codebase!
