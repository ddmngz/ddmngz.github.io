For fun, I made a little website to generate your own New York Times Connections Puzzle! The game logic is in Rust/Webassembly, but the rest is pure HTML JS and CSS! You can try it out [here](/connections)

I thought it would be interesting to try compressing a file by generating a function that would produce the file on a given seed, and storing the seed and the function. This has been a really interesting vehicle to learn more about cryptography and hash functions, and I'm really excited to see how the implementation turns out!

I inherited CULD Hub from an old member of the Columbia University lion dance club, Ethan Wu. He made it as a tool for organizing club performances, but also as a way to learn web app development! At first, it was simply a matter of learning the technologies, understanding the codebase, and migrating it off of Heroku, but nowadays I've been working on it on my own! Adding new tools such as Equipment Management, Reimbursement Automation, and an Availability Display!
